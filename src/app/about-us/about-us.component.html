            The Charles is an online school-independent platform that publishes weekly feature-length documentaries and free-flowing one-on-one discussions. We seek and sit down with groups and individuals whose stories, advocacies, passions inform and challenge our beliefs, opinions, and ideologies. Individuals whose ways of living compel us to be transformed inside and out.

          Our mission has two prongs: to tell stories and to transform lives.
          Author Ursula K. Le Guin once said, “The unread story is not a story.” Similarly, we, at The Charles, believe that the unheard story is not a story. Through thorough research, detailed documentation, and fair, entertaining reporting in the form of video series, we yearn to listen to and share worthwhile stories and ideas.<br><br>

          Listening to stories expands the imagination and telling them lets us leap over cultural boundaries, allowing us to experience inclusivity amidst diversity. We strive to encourage civil and meaningful discussions among members of our society, challenge beliefs, and inspire positive changes in the world.

          We don’t just change the world through the stories we tell. We transform individual lives through the partnerships we build. We seek and sit down with the underprivileged members of society, understand their needs and tell their story, with a goal of connecting them with generous donors—private individuals, groups, and institutions—who can satisfy their needs.<br><br>

          In return, The Charles recognizes our donors by promoting their ventures, goods and services and/or raising awareness about their projects and advocacies with the goal of helping them expand. By helping channel resources from those who have the means to those who are in need, we envision to create a society where everyone has the opportunity to have a brighter future and a brighter story.
